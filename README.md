# pewvcSolver
This program solves the Poisson Equation with Variable Coefficents in 2 dimensional space. It is using a square ordinary equidistant grid with a nine-point stencil for general, non-diagonal permeability. There are also functions for measuring convergence and for comparing different discretization schemas to each other.
